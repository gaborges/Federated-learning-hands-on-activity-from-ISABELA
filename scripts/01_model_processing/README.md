# Model processing folder

This folder has the scripts that process the data and generates the results.

It was three files:
- **MLP_didatic_federated_example.ipynb**: it has a code with a basic the Multi-layer Perceptron to a classification problem.
- **RNN_LSTM_didatic_federated_example.ipynb**: it has a code of time sequence classification with Long short-term memory algorithm.
- **federated_learning_for_image_classification.ipynb**: it has the example from Google with image processing.

First, access the file **MLP_didatic_federated_example.ipynb**, read the comments and execute until the end.

Second, access the file **RNN_LSTM_didatic_federated_example.ipynb**, read the comments and execute until the end.

Third,  access the file **federated_learning_for_image_classification.ipynb**, read the comments and execute until the end.
